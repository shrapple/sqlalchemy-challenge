# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this challenge I utlized two csv files containing information regarding Hawaii's precipitation levels in order to find optimal times to vacation there. 
I began with opening and looking at the csv files, I then did my analysis in my Jupyter notebook.
After, in VS Code I created an API to include certain data I had found in my analysis.
